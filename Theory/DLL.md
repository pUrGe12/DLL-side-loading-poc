Dynamic Link Library, or DLL for short, is Microsoftâ€™s implementation of the _shared library concept_. These libraries, have the extension .dll file extension, contain code and data that can be used by multiple programs at the same time. When an application requires a DLL to run, Windows attempts to load the DLL from either a full path defined by the application or via a manifest file. A manifest is essentially a plain text file that contains information about the dependencies and configuration requirements of an application or component.

Adversaries exploit poorly configured manifest files by placing a malicious DLL with the **same name as a legitimate DLL** in a location where an application will load it before the DLL that should be loaded.

Windows attempts to locate the DLL by searching a predefined set of directories in a set order as below:

-	The directory from which the application is loaded (if that happens to be the current directory then be it)
-	The system directory
-	The 16-bit system directory
-	The windows directory
-	The current working directory
-	The directories listed in the PATH environment variable

The earliest known exploit that used this DLL side loading is, `CVE-2000-0854` (When a Microsoft Office 2000 document is launched, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLLs such as `riched20.dll` and `msi.dll`, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting a Trojan Horse DLL into the same directory as the document).
